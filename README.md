# MCP (Model Context Protocol)

## Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard developed by Anthropic to streamline and standardize the integration of large language models with external data sources and tools. Acting as a universal adapter—much like USB-C for devices—MCP enables AI systems to access real-time information and execute actions across diverse environments without relying solely on pre-trained internal knowledge.

## Architecture & Key Concepts

MCP is built on a robust client–server architecture that decouples AI host applications from the external systems they interact with. Key components include:

- **MCP Hosts/Clients:**\
  AI applications (e.g., chatbots, IDE integrations, desktop assistants) that initiate connections. Each host spawns dedicated MCP clients to manage secure, isolated interactions with external servers.

- **MCP Servers:**\
  Lightweight programs that expose specific capabilities such as:

  - **Resources:** Data or content accessible by the AI.
  - **Prompts:** Pre-defined templates and workflows to guide interactions.
  - **Tools:** Functions and actions that the AI can execute on external systems.

- **Communication:**\
  MCP uses JSON-RPC as its messaging backbone—operating over transports like standard input/output (stdio) or HTTP with Server-Sent Events (SSE)—to ensure lightweight, reliable, and bidirectional communication between clients and servers.

- **Modularity & Security:**\
  The clear separation between host and server components promotes modular integration and scalability, while built-in sandboxing and access controls enhance security.

## Why It Matters

MCP addresses critical challenges in modern AI development:

- **Simplified Integration:**\
  Standardizes the connection between AI models and various external resources, reducing the need for custom-built connectors for every new data source or tool.

- **Enhanced Context Awareness:**\
  By providing direct access to up-to-date and domain-specific data, MCP improves the relevance and accuracy of AI responses, reducing hallucinations.

- **Facilitating Autonomous AI:**\
  Enables the development of sophisticated, agentic AI systems that can orchestrate complex workflows by seamlessly invoking external tools and services.

- **Future-Proofing AI Applications:**\
  A unified protocol ensures that AI systems remain flexible and adaptable, capable of integrating new technologies and expanding functionalities without major rework.
